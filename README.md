# CS2520 Assignment 6
refactoring functions

updated star and cloud loops:
  This code uses list comprehension to create the stars and clouds lists in a more concise way. It also eliminates the need for temporary variables x, y, and r.

simplied draw_cloud:
  This code stores the ellipse coordinates and dimensions in a list and then iterates over the list to draw each ellipse using a loop. This reduces the number of lines of code from 5 to 2.
